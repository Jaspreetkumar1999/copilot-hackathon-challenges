# Challenge 4 â€“ Convert powershellscript to bash

## 1. Setup Your Development Environment

### Setup vscode with powershell extension:

- Use IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code (with Java support and Copilot enabled).

## 2. If a folder does not exist for this Challenge, create one

e.g. challenge-4

## 3. Create new .ps1 file

e.g. `start.ps1`

## 4. let copilot create our starting point

- Open the file and start Copilot with *Ctrl+I*
- Ask Copilot to create a Powershell function which calculates the CRC32 checksum for a given file (input parameter is the path to the file)
- The checksum has to be returned as a String
- Start the Script

## 5. Convert into Bash

- Create a new Bash file (`start.sh`)
- Ask Copilot to convert your Script into Bash
- Attach the `start.ps1` file with "Attach Context" to Copilot
- Run Copilot
